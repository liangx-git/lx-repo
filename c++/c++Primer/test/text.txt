I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor's lips are presently
dripping with the words of nullification, will be transformed into a situation where
little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and
white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a
dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made
low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight,
and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. This is
our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be
able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be
able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to
struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that
we will be free one day.
